# StatistExcel
This is collection of useful VBA functions for doing some statistics in Excel. These could be useful when Excel is the only statistical program allowed on your computer. Some of the forecasting functions now have builtin equivalents in Excel. The  VBA files are also provided as text files.
# FORECASTING
This provides an array function developed in vba for time series forecasting in Excel. 
It is able to run many different types of time series forecasting including simple exponential smoothing,
double exponential smoothing, Brown's double exponential smoothing, additive triple exponential smoothing,
and multiplicative exponential smoothing. 

# LINEAR_REG
This is a array function for multivariate linear regression. It is essentially just a wrapper function for linest(). It returns the parameter estimates in the same order as they are input. It also calculates additional statistics and provides a prediction option. 

# LOGISTIC_REG
This is an array function that runs Logistic Regression on the inputs. It can provide parameter estimates and statistics or predictions. 

# BOXCOX_REG
This is an array function that runs BoxCox Regression on the inputs. It can provide parameter estimates and statistics or predictions. Not fully debugged.
